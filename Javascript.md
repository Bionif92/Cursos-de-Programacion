# Javascript Course

## Getting Started

### Prettier VS Code Format Document

`File -> Preferences ->Keyboard Shortcuts`
Type `Format Document`
Option `Shift + Alt + F`

### VSCode settings

`File -> Preferences -> Settings`
`User` applied to all projects
`Workspace` applied to the a specific project

### Using incognito mode on VSCode

It helps preventing extensions running extra code on our apps

### Dev Tool Chrome

`Control + Shift + I`

## Basics: Variables, Data Types, Operators & Functions

`Control + S`Save document

how to add JS code to an `html` file?

1) ```html
   <head>
    <script>
        alert('hey, I'm an alert!)
    </script>
   </head>
   ```

the downside: the html gets long an messy with inline JS.

2) ```html
   <head>
       <script src="path-to-the-JS-file"> </script >
   </head>
   ```
3) Add the script to the end of the `<body>`:
   
   ```html
   <body>
       <script src="path-to-the-JS-file"> </script >
   </body>
   ```

#### The order if JS imports matter

### Declaring variables

A variable can be declared, but not defined, so it becomes a **uninitialized variable**:

```js
let currentResult;
```
and the value is `undefined`.
Use let to declare the variable, then is not need it more

`let`For defining a variable that can change
`const`For a variable that canÂ´t change

### Operators

Styntax features that let us manipulate values

#### Mathematical operators

the not known by me are:

1) `%` that returns the remainder of dividing two numbers. 

2) `**`Exponentiation, `2**3=8`

The operators return things, e.g `+` like the SUM result of two number

#### Data Types
1) Numbers
2) Strings `Hi`The single coma for text, filled with text, nothing or numbers

### String concatenation

adding dinamyc values to strings:

```js
let fullName = 'Franco ' + surname + ' some extra random surname'
```
the `+` operator here doesn't SUM numbers but it joins strings into a single one. Downside? messy syntax. It's better to do **string interpolation**.

### Template literals or string interpolation

is the solution to string concatenation, which is ugly.



```js
let greeting = `Welcome onboard ${userName}`
```

### Writting strings into multiple lines:

#### with string interpolation:

```js
let greeting = `Hello


this is multiline string`
```

in the browser, it looks like this:

`Hello this is a multiline string`

#### With single or double quotes

```js
let greeting = 'Hello ' +
                'this is multiline string'
```

White spaces and tab spaces are not taking into account, because there's a calculation`+` in between. 

So, how to add line breakes and spaces then?

```js
let greeting = 'Hello \n
                this is a multiline string'
```

this `/n` can also be used for backticks, but it's not used too much because the backticks allow line splitting in the code already

The `\` character escapes the next one, that means that then next one is not treated ,e.g, as a normal `n`, but is combined with with the `\` to form a `line break`

More escape sequences here: [String - JavaScript | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#Escape_notation)

### Functions

functions are code on demand.

```js
function addNumbers (num1, num2) {
    //do something here
    return something
}
```
Can write the funtion wherever you want
