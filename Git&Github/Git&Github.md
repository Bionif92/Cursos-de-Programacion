# Git & Github Course

## Getting Started

Git: version managment tool

Github: brings git capabilities to the cloud

### Git 

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

You only have one file, but you can bring back previous states of the same work

 - Version Control System+
 - Manage Code History
 - Track Changes
 - Local tool

### Github

 - Largest Development Platform
 - Cloud Hosting & Collaboration Provider
 - Git Repository Hosting

## Windows Command Prompt

Command Prompt (cmd)

````cmd
cd .. // move a folder backwards

dir // see content

D: // change to disc D

cd Users // move to Users folder from relative path

cd Desktop\git-basics // move to that folder

cd C:\Users\Franco // move from absolute path

cd / // go to the root directory

cls // clear command prompt
````
You use absolute path for development

### Creating-Deleting Files & Foulders

````cmd
mkdir command-prompt // you create a foulder where you are

echo our first file > test.txt // content name-of-file file-type

type text.txt // show you our first file

del text.txt // delete the file

rmdir command-prompt // delete the foulder
````

### Copying and moving files

````cmd
copy test2.txt other // copy the file into the other foulder

move test2.txt other // move the file into the other foulder

move other main // move main foulder into main foulder
````

## Version Managment with Git

Commit -> Snapshot

Master Branch -> All commits

Git = Tracking changes, not storing files again and again

You can make a duplicate of the running work, make the changes you want with commits, and when it is finish, modify the exisiting one

### Installing Git

 1. Download Git from the page and install
 2. See the version installed with this:
````bash
git --version
````

### Initializing first Repository & Creating first Commit

Use command prompt on terminar VSC

````bash
git status // see status of repositories

git init // to initialize git in the foulder, create git foulder for repositories

git add initial-commit.txt // can add more files next to the one listed

git add . // track all the files
````

With this you put the files in the staging area

````bash
git commit -m "added first .txt file" // commit the change, with that message

git config --global user.email "email"

git config --global user.name "name"// need this to configure first to let you run commit
````

### Diving in Commits with log

````bash
git log // see the commits, most important the id 

git checkout id // you will be back to that step

git checkout master // you get back all things
````
This is explained in the next lecture

### Understanding and creating Branches

````bash
git branch // see all the branches, master is the default

git branch name-new-branch // create new branch

git checkout name-new-branch // switch branches

git chechout -b name-new-branch // shortcut for the previous two steps
````
If we create a branch based on another branch then all commits will be taken into this new branch

### Mergin Branches

Need to be in the branch you want the changes

````bash
git merge third-branch // add the new things from third-branch to master
````

### Understanding Head

For default, it is the latest commit on a branch

### Detached Head

Working with a commit you choose, outside any branch

````bash
git checkout id // you are in the detached head

git branch // you see the branches and the detached head
````

### Branches & Git Switch

````bash
git switch third-branch // other way to switch branches

git switch -c four-branch // create and switch to a new branch
````

### Deleting-Working Directory Files

If you delete the file normally, you will have the existing one in your commit

````bash
git ls-files // see the files in the commit

git rm working-with-branches.txt // delete the file from the commit
````

### Undoing Unstaged Changes

If you make a change in a file and you want to undo it:

````bash
git checkout the-file.txt // undo the file to the commit

git checkout . // undo all the files to the commit

git restore // the same thing instead of checkout

git clean -dn // see which untracked files will be deleted

git clean -df // delete the untracked files
````

### Undoing Staged Changes

After you use git add to the staged part, if you dont wont to commit, you can do this:
````bash
git reset initial-commit.txt // not so used
git chechout initial-commit.txt // after this to step it will restore the file

git restore -- staged initial-commit.txt 
git chechout initial-commit.txt // same as the two step named before
````

### Deleting Stages with Git Reset

Git Reset helps you reset the head of our branch, basically undo commits

````bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1// Remove one commit, but the stage is on, and the file too because we select soft reset

git reset HEAD~1// Remove one commit, the stage but not the file

git reset --hard HEAD~1 // Remove everything
````

### Deleting Branches

````bash
git branch -D fourth-branch // delete branch
````

### Commiting Detached Head Changes

Commit to the master branch

````bash
git chechout commit-id// detached head

git add .
git commit -m "message"// make changes 

git switch master // need to generate a new branch with the id they gave you

git branch "detached-branch" id-given
````
If you want to put this branch information into master:
````bash
git switch master

git merge detached-branch
````
Can also create a new branch with the changes of the detached and then merge to master

### Understanding .gitignore

Some of the files you dont want to work with git:

Make a .gitignore file:
```js
the-file.txt //file you want to ignore

Other way
*.log // all log files are ignored
!test.log // this one has not to be ignored

Other way
web-app/* // the foulder with all the things inside are ignored
```
Need to add .gitignore to the track files

## Diving Deeper into Git

### Understanding the Stash

You make progress, you want to go back to the previous commit, but you dont want to make a new commit of the changes

Stash - internal memory, you can save uncommited unstaged changes

```js
git stash // go back to the previous commit

git stash apply // bring back your changes, the latest ones

git stash list // see all the stash apllied as a list

git stash apply 0 // go to the latest, if 1 go to the previous and so on

git stash push - m "message" // push a stach with a message

git stash pop 0 // add the stash to the commit, then you need to add and commit into a new commit

git stash drop 1 // delete the stash

git stash clear // clear all stash
```

### Bringing Lost Data Back

If you make a hard reset, how to bring back the lost data:
```js
git reflog // storage of 30 days, search de commit you lost and have the id

git reset --hard id // head change to the commit we deleted before

Also for branches

git reflog 
git checkout id // create detached head
git switch -c feature // new feature branch
```

### Merge Types

 - Fast Forward
 - Non Fast Forward (Recursive, Octopus, Ours, Subtree)

### Fast Forward Mege

Condition: no additional commit in master (after feature branch was created)
Merge moves HEAD forward but does not create a new commit

```js
Create the branch feature, and the crate the foulder feature with the changes

git switch master
git merge feature // head moved to master to the last commit on feature

git merge --squash feature // head is not updated, all the new features are added to the stage, then you have to commit this changes
```

### The Recursive Merge

Additional commits in both master and feature branch after feature branch was created
```js
git merge --no-ff feature // both branches are merged and create the commit by themselves

To bring back to the latest commit of mater, only have to reset the merge
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Appling Git Rebase

Rebasing -- modify the branch adding the changes of master to it

The rebase does not move commits, it creates new commits. **It is a problem if you work with a proyect with more people**

```cmp
//first in feature branch
git rebase master // rebase feature with new ids

git switch master
git merge feature
```

When consider using:

 - New commits in master branch while working on feature branch
 - If features relies on additional changes on master
 - Feature is finish - implementation into master without merge commit

### Handling Merge Conflicts

If you want to merge master with feature, and in one file, the content is different in the same line

In the file, you will see:

 - Accept current change
 - Accept incoming change
 - Accept both changes
 - Compare changes (highlight the differences)

```cmp
git status // you can see the problem and the solutions, same with git log --merge
// you can fix problem and commit or:
git merge --abort
git diff // you can see also the problems you have
```

### Cherry Pick

Cherry Picking - Add a specific commit to a branch (HEAD), copies commit with new id+

In the example, something in master is wrong, we made a new branch, make new features and correct the mistake, and we only want to modify this change in master

```cmp
// from feature switch to master
git cherry-pick id-commit // change mistake in master with a new id
```

### Working with Tags

Tag - to put a tag into the commit to find it quickly

Git supports two types of tags: lightweight and annotated. A lightweight tag is very much like a branch that doesn't change â€” **it's just a pointer to a specific commit**. Annotated tags, however, are stored as full objects in the Git database.

```cmp
git tag // list of tags in the proyect

git tag 1.0 id-commit // lightweight tag

git show 1.0 // show you the commit

git checkout 1.0 // we refer to that commit

git tag -d 1.0 // delete the tag

git tag -a 2.0  -m "This is the latest version"//annotated
```

## Understanding GitHub


### What is Github?

Github -  Remote repository

### Creating Remote Repository

Create a Repository on GitHub

### Connect Local with Remote Repository

We will use the second option: **push an existing repository from the command line**

````
// VSC terminal
git init
git add .
git commit 
git remote add origin (url) //url given in the repository
git branch -M main // rename master to main, if you want you can keep master
git push origin main // or master
````
Appear a Pop Up to sign to GitHub, need token

### Create Token

Github/Menu/Settings/Developers Settings/Personal Access Tokens/Generate New Token

Need to give access to the sepecif things we need:

 - Repo
 - workflow
 - write packages
 - delete packages
 - gits
 - users
 - delete repo
 - write discussions

### Pushing a second commit

````
// VSC terminal
git add .
git commit 
git push origin master
git branch -a // can see local and remote tracking branch
````

In Github, in history you can see the commits

### Remote Tracking Branch

Copy of remote branch in local
